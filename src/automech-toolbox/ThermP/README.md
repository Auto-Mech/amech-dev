# ThermP

This program reads in canonical partition functions and calculates them them into thermochemical parameters: Cp, S, and H.

### Requirements

While not strictly required, ThermP makes use of output from the MESS program by default.

The user may format partition function data from some other program to match those in the examples directory. Of course, we encourage the use of MESS to calculate the input partition function data. 

The source code and installation instructions for MESS can be found at <https://github.com/Auto-Mech/MESS>.
